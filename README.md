# Vaccinator

## Prologue
For the last six years I have been working in cyber security.  
I am tired to be always behind the attackers.  
This tool is supposed to prevent some of the malwares to even run in my organistration.  
This tool is supposed to vaccinate the workstation.  

## About the project
This project supposed to vaccinate your workstation from malware's.
In an attempt to evade analysis and being detected, malware often detects:
1) The presence of a forensic process running
2) The presence of VM Indicators.
3) The presence of Snadbox Indicators.
Mostly if the malware detects one of the above it will be suspended or closed or "act natural" (Do only legitimate stuff) so it won't be detected.
