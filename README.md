# Vaccinator

This project supposed to vaccinate your workstation from malware's.
In an attempt to evade analysis and being detected, malware often detects:
1) The presence of a forensic process running
2) The presence of VM Indicators.
3) The presence of Snadbox Indicators.
Mostly if the malware detects one of the above it will be suspended or closed or "act natural" (Do only legitimate stuff) so it won't be detected.
